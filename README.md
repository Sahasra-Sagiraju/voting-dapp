This is a voting dapp created for our blockchain assignment.

In this app, we can create elections simply by passing an array of Contestants and the duration that this election should be held for.

After the elections start, voters can vote using their account. Once a vote has been registered, the voter can't vote again.

Technologies used: React.js, TailwindCSS, Solidity, Hardhat and Ether.

Note: Not uploading the .env file was a conscious decision, as information in that file should be private.
